# Specification Quality Checklist: Low Renewables Guard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- User explicitly rejected export suppression (FR-007 documents this).
- User confirmed Path B (Amber Express renewables %) as the trigger source.
- User requested peak solar reference be configurable, not fixed (FR-008, FR-009).
- User requested daytime solar capture component 10:00-15:00 (FR-006).
- User requested SoC target drive rather than fixed overnight charge window (FR-005).
