# MANDATORY SPEC-KIT ENFORCEMENT
**rule_id**: speckit_process_enforcement

1. **NO CODE WITHOUT SPEC**: You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from modifying any source code (`.py`, `.js`, etc.) until the feature has been formally defined in the project's specification documents (`system_requirements.md` / `spec.md`).
2. **PLAN BEFORE EXECUTION**: An `implementation_plan.md` must be written and approved before execution.
3. **TASK DRIVEN**: Work must be tracked via `task.md`.
4. **NO "VIBING"**: Do not launch straight into code changes based simply on user vibes or immediate requests. You must halt, document the requirement, plan the implementation, and update tasks, BEFORE touching the codebase.
